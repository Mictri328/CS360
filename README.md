Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

    The weight tracking app needed to be a place a user could login and input weight data daily and log the inputs. They have a goal weight that is used to compare the daily updates and when the results are less or equal to the goal the user may receive a SMS signaling the completion of the goal if they opted to receive the text. They must also create and use a login username and password to track their specific data. The user may also choose to read, update, and delete data that is displayed in their graph. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

	The user needed a login screen, registration screen, SMS request screen and finally the main screen that held bulk of the app. I kept the layouts simple and easy to follow only having each screen contain necessary items and then moving on to a new screen. Text views and Edit views are used to help guide the users on what belongs in each input field and the buttons all labeled to understand what they do when pressed. 



How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

	I started in order of how I wanted the user to interact with the app. Starting with the login screen/ registration page. This way while crafting the pages and databases I could get them functional quick enough for testing. Once those pages finished, I moved to the main screen of the app. That held another database that I could display on the page and work again together with main screens functionality. This helped me maneuver through testing after each piece of code was completed. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

	Testing went one section at a time with my work. I started with login and registration by trying different usernames and passwords to see if they would allow access and ask for SMS permissions when created. I even deleted the app off the AVD android phone and reinstalled to keep testing that app would function from install to first use. I then used the main page to input different weights and dates and played with the delete and update functions of the app. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
	For me the biggest issues came from the database portions of the code. I had to review several tutorials on database creation and using all the features SQLite had to offer. Even once completed with parts of code I had a lot of errors that needed to be fixed and changed or edited due to improper wording or syntax errors. Once that was completed adding them into the listeners seemed to work a lot easier for me.  


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

	The design portion went a lot better for me than the coding. Laying out color scheme and placement of texts and buttons in an easy-to-follow order that any user could figure out. I got to get into the mind of the users I was creating the app for and thought how they would be looking and interacting with the app.
